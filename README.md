# Compiler

In this project, one of my friends and I made a compiler for a grammar which you can see in "grammar.g4" file. That grammar was produced for modelling a kind of negotiation and our task was to compile that kind of grammar to a c++ code which could calculate the amount of money you should pay/get after accepting those negotiations. Honestly, It's a really simple compiler.
